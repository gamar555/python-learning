#üß† Day 1 - Python Cafe Menu Ordering App

## ‚úÖ What I Learned
- How to define and use a Python dictionary
- Taking user input with `input()`
- Using loops (`while`) to handle multiple user inputs
- Conditional checks using `if`, `else`
- String formatting using f-strings
- Calculating total cost of ordered items
- Basic receipt generation using loop and formatting

## üçΩÔ∏è Project Description
I created a simple terminal-based menu ordering system for a virtual Python Cafe.

The program:
- Displays a menu with item prices
- Takes multiple orders from the user until they type `'done'`
- Handles quantity input for each item
- Calculates and displays a receipt with item-wise cost and the total

## üìå Key Features
- Menu printed from a dictionary using `.items()`
- Input is made case-insensitive using `.strip().lower()`
- Receipt includes quantity, unit price, and total price for each item

## üßæ Sample Output
